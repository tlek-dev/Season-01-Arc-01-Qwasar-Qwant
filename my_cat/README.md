# Welcome to My Cat
***

## Task
The program should read the contents of each file received as an argument to my software without any processing options.

## Description
Here I used the 'open' and 'O_RDONLY' functions to open reading. Next, a while loop is used and the 'read' function is written in it to calculate the bytes from the buffer. At the end, I used the number 'close' to close the file

## Installation
In this case, installation via npm is not required.

## Usage
When opening docode in the terminal, write 'gcc -v my_cat.c'
